# My Personal Project

## ToDo List app

I'm making a todo list app. As the name suggests it is an app for organizing your 
tasks. It is intended to be used by people who have so many of tasks they sometimes lose track, or for people
like me, who tend to forget things.

This project is an interest of mine, because as stated above, I tend to forget things.

*User Stories*:
- As a user, I want to be able to add tasks to the todo list
- As a user, I want to be able to remove tasks from the todo list
- As a user, I want to be able to view all my tasks
- As a user, I want to be able to mark my tasks as complete or incomplete
- As a user, I want to filter between completed or incomplete tasks
- As a user, I want to be able to see the objective of my tasks
- As a user, I want to be able to save my todo list for later use
- As a user, I want to be able to load my previously saved todo list

###Note
This is my first time working with persistence in java,
so I have modeled the code for the persistence package and its tests
from the sample application that was provided.

#### Phase 4: Task 2

Fri Nov 26 15:54:09 PST 2021
new task was added to the ToDo List
Fri Nov 26 15:54:16 PST 2021
another task was added to the ToDo List
Fri Nov 26 15:54:20 PST 2021
new task's status was updated
Fri Nov 26 15:54:31 PST 2021

#### Phase 4: Task 3

If given more time, I would make a separate class to render the GUI
rather than just write the required code in the ui(ToDoListApp) class. I would also 
try to remove some of the repetitiveness in the code.
